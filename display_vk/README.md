# display_vk
## Summary
`display_vk` defines a service called `display_vk` which inherits from `display_sink`. The `display_vk` class is responsible for setting up and managing a Vulkan-based display sink. The `setup_vk()` function initializes GLFW and Vulkan, while the `recreate_swapchain()` function recreates the Vulkan swapchain. The `setup_vk()` function creates a Vulkan instance using the `vkb::InstanceBuilder` class from the `vkb` library. The instance is configured with validation layers and a debug callback function.
