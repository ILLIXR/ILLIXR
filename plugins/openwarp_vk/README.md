# openwarp_vk

## Summary

`openwarp_vk` is an Vulkan-based translational reprojection service intended for use in the ILLIXR architecture. 

## Phonebook Service

`openwarp_vk` is registered as a service in phonebook, conforming to the `timewarp` render pass interface. Three functions are exposed:

* `setup(VkRenderPass render_pass, uint32_t subpass)` initializes the required Vulkan pipeline and resources given a specific render pass and subpass, to which `openwarp_vk` binds to
* `update_uniforms(const pose_type render_pose)` calculates the reprojection matrix given the current pose and the pose used to render the frame, and updates the uniform buffer with the reprojection matrix. This must be called before `record_command_buffer` is called
* `record_command_buffer(VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, int left)` records the commands into a given command buffer that would perform the reprojection for one eye, for which 1 is left and 0 is right
