A good potion of the code base has been refactored/reorganized to both standardize the code and group similar parts together. There were a total of 16 pull requests merged which introduced 10 new plugins, overhauled several others, and addressed 13 issues. The new plugins include remote rendering, hand tracking, and ORB_SLAM. Vulkan is now the default display back-end, and due to this, some of the OpenGL based plugins may not work on every system. See below for more detailed notes on the changes.</li> <li>Plugins<ul> <li>Introduces a new ORB_SLAM3 based plugin. By @hungdche in PR #407</li> <li>Deployed four new plugins: hand_tracking, webcam, hand_tracking.viewer, and zed.data_injection, reworked the zed plugin, and a zed_capture executable.<ul> <li>hand_tracking: detects and reports the positions of joints and fingertips; if depth information is available, or distances can be calculated by parallax, the reported coordinates are real-world in millimeters, otherwise they are in pixel coordinates</li> <li>webcam: captures images from a webcam and publishes them to the <code>webcam</code> topic</li> <li>hand_tracking.viewer: gui based interface for visualizing the output of the hand_tracker in real time</li> <li>zed.data_injection: reads in data from disk and publishes it as if it were the zed plugin, good for debugging and testing</li> <li>zed: now publishes information about the camera (pixels, field of view, etc.) which is required for some modes of depth sensing; also now publishes the pose corresponding to the current images; these are in addition to the images and IMU information it has always published</li> <li>zed_capture: a standalone executable used to capture the images and poses from the zed camera and write them to disk (currently does not capture depth information); the products of this executable are intended to be used by the zed.data_injection plugin   By @astro-friedel in PR #428</li> </ul> </li> <li>The hand tracking plugin now can be used as an OpenXR API Layer, where it will intercept calls to get hand tracking data. It has been tested with Monado, but should be generally compatible. Adheres to OpenXR-1.0 standards. By @astro-friedel in PR #436</li> <li>Deployed the following plugins:<ul> <li>tcp_network_backend: a backend for Switchboard using TCP to transmit topics between two connected ILLIXR instances</li> <li>offload_rendering_server: encodes OpenXR frames with FFMPEG and transmits them across the Switchboard network backend</li> <li>offload_rendering_client: decodes frames transmitted from an offload_rendering_server instance and adds decoded frames to a buffer pool</li> <li>openwarp_vk: an implementation of OpenWarp, 6-DoF asynchronous reprojection, in ILLIXR</li> <li>lighthouse: uses libsurvive to connect with Valve Index lighthouses for head tracking native_renderer has been reworked so that external applications can run asynchronously with reprojection.   By @qinjunj, @Jebbly, @shg8 in PR #437</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Infrastructure<ul> <li>File loading is used by several plugins, each with their own code. The file loading code has been centralized into <code>data_loading.hpp</code>. By @astro-friedel in PR #416</li> <li>Fixed an issue where plugins needed to be specified in the correct order, or they would throw an exception. By @astro-friedel in PR #417</li> <li>Fixed an issue when changing a profile name and re-running CMake. By @astro-friedel in PR #418</li> <li>The Runge-Kutta code was replicated several times in the code base. This code has now been centralized and rewritten to make it compatible with the current ILLIXR license. By @astro-friedel in PR #421</li> <li>Updated the tcp socket code so that it can be distributed under the current ILLIXR license. By @williamsentosa95 in PR #424</li> <li>The hand tracking plugin introduced a large number of breaking and non-breaking changes to the base structures used by ILLIXR.<ul> <li>breaking: the <code>cam_type</code> structures have been completely overhauled<ul> <li>all now inherit from a <code>cam_base_type</code> base struct, allowing for the <code>cam_base_type</code> to be used as a function argument type, letting a single function handle several different types of image input</li> <li>all <code>cam_base_type</code> based structs are now defined in the common headers (under include/illixr) rather than in some plugins</li> <li>there are now the following types: <code>binocular_cam_type</code>, <code>monocular_cam_type</code>, <code>rgb_depth_type</code>, <code>depth_type</code>, and <code>cam_type_zed</code></li> </ul> </li> <li>breaking: the header <code>data_format.hpp</code> was getting too large and complex; it has been broken up into multiple headers under the <code>data_format</code> directory, with all struts and functions inside the <code>ILLIXR::data_format</code> namespace<ul> <li>camera_data.hpp: structures used to describe the physical characteristics of a camera (# pixels, field of view, etc.)</li> <li>coordinate.hpp: enums for labelling the coordinate reference axes (e.g. LEFT_HANDED_Y_UP, RIGHT_HANDED_Y_UP, RIGHT_HANDED_Z_UP_X_FWD)</li> <li>frame.hpp: the <code>rendered_frame</code> struct</li> <li>hand_tracking_data: structs for holding positional information of points of a hand</li> <li>imu.hpp: all imu related structs</li> <li>misc.hpp: definitions that didn't fit with anything else</li> <li>opencv_data_types.hpp: most <code>cam_base_type</code> structs</li> <li>point.hpp: various structs for holding information about a point in 3D space</li> <li>pose.hpp: all pose related structs</li> <li>shape.hpp: structs related to shapes (e.g. rectangle)</li> <li>template.hpp: common templated functions</li> <li>unit.hpp: enums and functions related to units of measure</li> <li>zed_cam.hpp: the <code>cam_type_zed</code> struct; this is kept separate from the other <code>cam_base_type</code> due to potential dependencies on ZED headers, which not all systems have</li> </ul> </li> <li>The pose structures were expanded to hold additional information used by the hand_tracking code, these additions do not affect current uses of these structures   By @astro-friedel in PR #428, #440</li> </ul> </li> <li>Environment variable handling has been introduced to the <code>switchboard</code>. Calls to <code>std::getenv</code> have been replaced with calls to <code>swithchboard-&gt;get_env</code>, <code>switchbaord-&gt;get_env_char</code>, or <code>switchbaord-&gt;get_env_bool</code> and calls to <code>std::setenv</code> have been replaced with calls to <code>switchboard-&gt;set_env</code>. This change allows the switchboard to act as a broker for all environment variables. Additionally, environment variables can now be specified on the command line or in a yaml file, and will be made available to all plugins via the switchboard. By @astro-friedel in PR #430</li> </ul> </li> <li>Misc<ul> <li>Breaking: Policies for contributing to the ILLIXR code base, as well as a general coding style guide have been introduced. The entire code base was overhauled to bring it into compliance with the style guide. By @astro-friedel in PR #419</li> <li>General documentation updates for ILLIXR. By @astro-friedel in PR #422</li> <li>Updated CMakeLists.txt to cleanly handle newer FindBoost capabilities, updated tags on some external packages, cleaned up CMake output, added some <code>include</code> lines required by newer gcc compiler versions, and added <code>all.yaml</code> profile for testing that the code fully builds. By @astro-friedel in PR #431</li> <li>Updated several external packages ILLIXR builds from source to newer versions. Official support for CentOS, Fedora, and Ubuntu 20 and below has been dropped, support for Ubuntu 24 has been added.

Traditionally, one would use std::getenv and std::setenv to get and set these items.

Using the switchboard interfaces allows for environment variables to be set from the command line and/or yaml file. It is strongly encouraged to the switchboard interface wherever possible.

For example:</p> <pre><code>main.dbg.exe --yaml=my.yaml --DATA_SOURCE=/home/my/data --PROCESS_DATA\n</code></pre> <p>This will set env environment variables <code>DATA_SOURCE</code> to <code>/home/my/data</code> and <code>PROCESS_DATA</code> to <code>True</code>.

Subsequently, performing <code>Line D</code> will rewrite the history in the public branch.\n  To preserve branch commit histories in the case that a rollback is needed, we will employ a checkpointing process\n  for force updated branches. This process will be manually performed, but may be automated in the future.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If <code>Line B</code> shows an update to master, the following example illustrates your local repository just after\nperforming <code>Line B</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>A -- B -- C -- P -- Q -- R       ## master\n           \\\n            D -- E -- F          ## issue-123-fixing-bug\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, commits <code>P</code>, <code>Q</code>, and <code>R</code> have been merged to <code>master</code>\n(from feature branches not shown) after feature branch <code>issue-123-fixing-bug</code> was\nforked from <code>master</code>.</p>\n<p>To checkpoint the <code>issue-123-fixing-bug</code> branch while it is checked out:</p>\n<pre><code>git branch issue-123.0-fixing-bug                                   ## Make alias for old issue-123-fixing-bug\ngit checkout -b issue-123.1-fixing-bug                              ## Make new branch to rebase with master\ngit rebase master                                                   ## Replay issue-123-fixing-bug onto master\ngit branch -D issue-123-fixing-bug                                  ## Remove old issue-123-fixing-bug\ngit branch issue-123-fixing-bug                                     ## Make issue-123-fixing-bug an alias of new branch\ngit push  issue-123.{0,1}-fixing-bug                 ## Push new checkpointed branches to remote\ngit push  issue-123-fixing-bug --force-with-lease    ## Force update issue-123-fixing-bug\n\n\n<p>Note</p>\n<p>The term alias here is used to refer to branches which point to the same commit. This usage is different from standard Git Aliases used for git command shortcuts.</p>\n\n<p>After checkpointing, your local repository should look as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>                           D' -- E' -- F'   ## issue-123.1-fixing-bug, issue-123-fixing-bug\n                          /\nA -- B -- C -- P -- Q -- R                  ## master\n           \\\n            D -- E -- F                     ## issue-123.0-fixing-bug\n</code></pre>\n<p>Commits <code>D</code>, <code>E</code>, and <code>F</code> have been added to a new branch starting from <code>R</code>, but now have been given new hashes.\nThis new branch is our up-to-date copy of the feature branch <code>issue-123-fixing-bug</code>.</p>\n<p>While working on a checkpointed branch, keep aliases up-to-date using <code>git rebase</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>git commit                               ## Add changes to issue-123.1-fixing-bug\ngit checkout issue-123-fixing-bug        ## Switch to main issue-123-fixing-bug branch\ngit rebase issue-123.1-fixing-bug        ## Fast-forward issue-123-fixing-bug to issue-123.1-fixing-bug\n</code></pre>\n<p>Conflicts are possible when two or more collaborators push changes concurrently to the same branch. As long as\neach collaborator ensures that the branch update process starts at <code>Line A</code>, conflicts can be detected and handled\nlocally. In other words, every call to <code>git-push</code> should be preceded by a call to <code>git-pull</code>, following the\nprocess from <code>Line A</code> to <code>Line D</code> (or equivalent; git's CLI allows many ways to achieve the same results).</p>\n\n<p>Note</p>\n<p><code>Line B</code> rebases the <code>master</code> branch assuming that we have checked out <code>master</code>. Forgetting to specify <code>master</code> in\n<code>Line B</code> may result in a lossy forced update in the example below. Forgetting to checkout <code>master</code> will\nimmediately apply your checked out feature branch's changes, possibly also resulting in a lossy forced update.</p>\n\n<p>The output of <code>Line B</code> for a collaborator after the checkpointing process may contain something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>From github.com:ILLIXR/ILLIXR\n  A..R          master                  -&gt; /master\n+ A..F'         issue-123-fixing-bug    -&gt; /issue-123-fixing-bug  (forced update)\n* [new branch]  issue-123.0-fixing-bug  -&gt; /issue-123.0-fixing-bug\n* [new branch]  issue-123.1-fixing-bug  -&gt; /issue-123.1-fixing-bug\n\n<p>Conflicts which do not involve updates to the <code>master</code> branch can be resolved simply by rebasing the current\nfeature branch with the updated feature branch, applying new changes on top of the updated feature branch:</p>\n<pre><code>## For the latest checkpoint X (local) and Y (remote), let Z := Y + 1 in\ngit checkout issue-123.X-fixing-bug -b issue-123.Z-fixing-bug       ## Make new branch issue-123.Z-fixing-bug\ngit rebase /issue-123.Y-fixing-bug                   ## Replay updates from issue-123.X-fixing-bug\ngit push  issue-123.Z-fixing-bug                     ## Make sure to update issue-123-fixing-bug after\n\n<p>The <code>--force-with-lease</code> argument in <code>Line D</code> is not required for our new checkpoint branch, since a new branch\nshould not conflict with a non-existing remote branch. We expect the subversion number for a new branch\nresulting from our checkpoint conflict resolution to be new and unique. If the push fails, another conflict has\noccurred, and checkpoint conflict resolution should be repeated. <code>Line D</code> should be safe to perform for the main\nfeature branch now that we have replayed our commits on top of the updated feature branch.</p>\n\n<p>Note</p>\n<p>In the above example, the <code>git-rebase</code> is performed using the remote copy of the checkpointed branch.\nWe do this because <code>Line B</code> will not fast-forward or force update our local branches\n(with the same subversion number as a conflicting remote branch, if any).</p>\n\n<p>In the case of a conflict with updates to <code>master</code>, <code>Line A</code> should show updates to both the <code>master</code> branch and\nthe feature branch to be pushed in <code>Line D</code>. A checkpointed version of the feature branch may also appear. This is\nbecause a feature branch should only be checkpointed in the presence of a change to the <code>master</code> branch. Forced\npushes should generally not be used for any other purpose. If multiple updates to <code>master</code> and the feature\nbranch have occurred, additional checkpointed versions of the feature branch may also appear.
