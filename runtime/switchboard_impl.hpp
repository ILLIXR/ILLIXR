/*
Proof of thread-safety:
- Since all instance members are private, proving each method is datarace-free implies the class is.
    - I prove this by showing every access is guarded by a lock, implemented atomically, or uses concurrent primitives (AKA the concurrentqueue.hpp implementatoin).
- All code in this module acquires _m_registry_lock before _m_callbacks_lock, and does not call any external code which could acquire a lock, therefore this is deadlock-free.
- (Bonus) none of the locks are contended in steady-state.

Caveat:
- See caveat on invoke_callbacks()
- See caveat on put()
