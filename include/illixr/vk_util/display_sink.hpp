 * @brief A display sink is a service that can display the rendered images to the screen.
 *
 * @details
 * A display sink is a service created with the necessary Vulkan resources to display the rendered images to the screen.
 * It is created either by display_vk, a plugin that configures the Vulkan resources and swapchain,
 * or by monado_vulkan_integration, which populate the Vulkan resources and swapchain from Monado.
 * Previously with the GL implementation, this was not required since we were using GL and Monado was using Vulkan.
