This release of ILLIXR brings many new features and capabilities. A good potion of the code base has been
refactored/reorganized to both standardize the code and group similar parts together. There were a total of 17 pull
requests merged which introduced 11 new plugins, overhauled several others, and addressed 13 issues. The new plugins
include remote rendering, hand tracking, and ORB_SLAM. Vulkan is not the default display back-end, and due to this, some
of the OpenGL based plugins may not work on every system. See below for more detailed notes on the changes.
