The hand tracking plugin introduced a large number of **breaking** and non-breaking changes to the base structures used by ILLIXR.
  - **breaking**: the `cam_type` structures have been completely overhauled
    - all now inherit from a `cam_base_type` base struct, allowing for the `cam_base_type` to be used as a function argument type, letting a single function handle several different types of image input
    - all `cam_base_type` based structs are now defined in the common headers (under include/illixr) rather than in some plugins
    - there are now the following types: `binocular_cam_type`, `monocular_cam_type`, `rgb_depth_type`, `depth_type`, and `cam_type_zed`
  - **breaking**: the header `data_format.hpp` was getting too large and complex; it has been broken up into multiple headers under the `data_format` directory, with all struts and functions inside the `ILLIXR::data_format` namespace
    - camera_data.hpp: structures used to describe the physical characteristics of a camera (# pixels, field of view, etc.)
    - coordinate.hpp: enums for labelling the coordinate reference axes (e.g. LEFT_HANDED_Y_UP, RIGHT_HANDED_Y_UP, RIGHT_HANDED_Z_UP_X_FWD)
    - frame.hpp: the `rendered_frame` struct
    - hand_tracking_data: structs for holding positional information of points of a hand
    - imu.hpp: all imu related structs
    - misc.hpp: definitions that didn't fit with anything else
    - opencv_data_types.hpp: most `cam_base_type` structs
    - point.hpp: various structs for holding information about a point in 3D space
    - pose.hpp: all pose related structs
    - shape.hpp: structs related to shapes (e.g. rectangle)
    - template.hpp: common templated functions
    - unit.hpp: enums and functions related to units of measure
    - zed_cam.hpp: the `cam_type_zed` struct; this is kept separate from the other `cam_base_type` due to potential dependencies on ZED headers, which not all systems have
  - The pose structures were expanded to hold additional information used by the hand_tracking code, these additions do not affect current uses of these structures
