# ILLIXR v4.1 (2025-10-06)

- Release Notes:
    This release of ILLIXR introduces a set of nine plugins for our Ada system, a distributed, power-aware, real-time scene provider for XR.
- Plugins
    - This is the first open-source release of **Ada**, implemented on top of the [ILLIXR](https://illixr.org) testbed. Ada provides a reproducible implementation of our ISMAR/TVCG 2025 [paper](https://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/Pubs/25-TVCG-Ada.pdf) results. Its features include:
        - Full implementation of **Adaâ€™s distributed scene provisioning pipeline**:
            - Efficient depth encoding with MSB (lossless) + LSB (tunable bitrate)
            - Decoupled volumetric fusion and scene extraction
            - Extraction-aware scene management
            - Real-time mesh compression with parallel encoding
        - **Device-side and server-side plugin set** for ILLIXR
        - Support for ScanNet dataset and InfiniTAM-based reconstruction
        - Example prepared ScanNet sequence for quick testing
      <br>By [@jianxiapyh](https://github.com/jianxiapyh) in PR [#462](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/462)
- Infrastructure
    - Some of the new plugins have dependencies which require the [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) compiler in order to be built. To avoid library conflicts, we recommend using the Clang compiler to build the entire project.

# ILLIXR v4.0 (2025-03-28)

- Release Notes:
    This release of ILLIXR brings many new features and capabilities. A good potion of the code base has been refactored/reorganized to both standardize the code and group similar parts together. There were a total of 16 pull requests merged which introduced 10 new plugins, overhauled several others, and addressed 13 issues. The new plugins include remote rendering, hand tracking, and ORB_SLAM. Vulkan is now the default display back-end, and due to this, some of the OpenGL based plugins may not work on every system. See below for more detailed notes on the changes.
- Plugins
    - Introduces a new ORB_SLAM3 based plugin. By [@hungdche](https://github.com/hungdche) in PR [#407](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/407)
    - Deployed four new plugins: hand_tracking, webcam, hand_tracking.viewer, and zed.data_injection, reworked the zed plugin, and a zed_capture executable.
        - hand_tracking: detects and reports the positions of joints and fingertips; if depth information is available, or distances can be calculated by parallax, the reported coordinates are real-world in millimeters, otherwise they are in pixel coordinates
        - webcam: captures images from a webcam and publishes them to the `webcam` topic
        - hand_tracking.viewer: gui based interface for visualizing the output of the hand_tracker in real time
        - zed.data_injection: reads in data from disk and publishes it as if it were the zed plugin, good for debugging and testing
        - zed: now publishes information about the camera (pixels, field of view, etc.) which is required for some modes of depth sensing; also now publishes the pose corresponding to the current images; these are in addition to the images and IMU information it has always published
        - zed_capture: a standalone executable used to capture the images and poses from the zed camera and write them to disk (currently does not capture depth information); the products of this executable are intended to be used by the zed.data_injection plugin
      By [@astro-friedel](https://github.com/astro-friedel) in PR [#428](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/428)
    - The hand tracking plugin now can be used as an OpenXR API Layer, where it will intercept calls to get hand tracking data. It has been tested with Monado, but should be generally compatible. Adheres to OpenXR-1.0 standards. By [@astro-friedel](https://github.com/astro-friedel) in PR [#436](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/436)
    - Deployed the following plugins:
        - tcp_network_backend: a backend for Switchboard using TCP to transmit topics between two connected ILLIXR instances
        - offload_rendering_server: encodes OpenXR frames with FFMPEG and transmits them across the Switchboard network backend
        - offload_rendering_client: decodes frames transmitted from an offload_rendering_server instance and adds decoded frames to a buffer pool
        - openwarp_vk: an implementation of [OpenWarp](https://github.com/Zee2/openwarp), 6-DoF asynchronous reprojection, in ILLIXR
        - lighthouse: uses [libsurvive](https://github.com/collabora/libsurvive) to connect with Valve Index lighthouses for head tracking native_renderer has been reworked so that external applications can run asynchronously with reprojection.
      By [@qinjunj](https://github.com/qinjunj), [@Jebbly](https://github.com/Jebbly), [@shg8](https://github.com/shg8) in PR [#437](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/437)
- Infrastructure
    - File loading is used by several plugins, each with their own code. The file loading code has been centralized into `data_loading.hpp`. By [@astro-friedel](https://github.com/astro-friedel) in PR [#416](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/416)
    - Fixed an issue where plugins needed to be specified in the correct order, or they would throw an exception. By [@astro-friedel](https://github.com/astro-friedel) in PR [#417](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/417)
    - Fixed an issue when changing a profile name and re-running CMake. By [@astro-friedel](https://github.com/astro-friedel) in PR [#418](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/418)
    - The Runge-Kutta code was replicated several times in the code base. This code has now been centralized and rewritten to make it compatible with the current ILLIXR license. By [@astro-friedel](https://github.com/astro-friedel) in PR [#421](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/421)
    - Updated the tcp socket code so that it can be distributed under the current ILLIXR license. By [@williamsentosa95](https://github.com/williamsentosa95) in PR [#424](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/424)
    - The hand tracking plugin introduced a large number of **breaking** and non-breaking changes to the base structures used by ILLIXR.
        - **breaking**: the `cam_type` structures have been completely overhauled
            - all now inherit from a `cam_base_type` base struct, allowing for the `cam_base_type` to be used as a function argument type, letting a single function handle several different types of image input
            - all `cam_base_type` based structs are now defined in the common headers (under include/illixr) rather than in some plugins
            - there are now the following types: `binocular_cam_type`, `monocular_cam_type`, `rgb_depth_type`, `depth_type`, and `cam_type_zed`
        - **breaking**: the header `data_format.hpp` was getting too large and complex; it has been broken up into multiple headers under the `data_format` directory, with all struts and functions inside the `ILLIXR::data_format` namespace
            - camera_data.hpp: structures used to describe the physical characteristics of a camera (# pixels, field of view, etc.)
            - coordinate.hpp: enums for labelling the coordinate reference axes (e.g. LEFT_HANDED_Y_UP, RIGHT_HANDED_Y_UP, RIGHT_HANDED_Z_UP_X_FWD)
            - frame.hpp: the `rendered_frame` struct
            - hand_tracking_data: structs for holding positional information of points of a hand
            - imu.hpp: all imu related structs
            - misc.hpp: definitions that didn't fit with anything else
            - opencv_data_types.hpp: most `cam_base_type` structs
            - point.hpp: various structs for holding information about a point in 3D space
            - pose.hpp: all pose related structs
            - shape.hpp: structs related to shapes (e.g. rectangle)
            - template.hpp: common templated functions
            - unit.hpp: enums and functions related to units of measure
            - zed_cam.hpp: the `cam_type_zed` struct; this is kept separate from the other `cam_base_type` due to potential dependencies on ZED headers, which not all systems have
        - The pose structures were expanded to hold additional information used by the hand_tracking code, these additions do not affect current uses of these structures
      By [@astro-friedel](https://github.com/astro-friedel) in PR [#428](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/428), [#440](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/440)
    - Environment variable handling has been introduced to the `switchboard`. Calls to `std::getenv` have been replaced with calls to `swithchboard->get_env`, `switchbaord->get_env_char`, or `switchbaord->get_env_bool` and calls to `std::setenv` have been replaced with calls to `switchboard->set_env`. This change allows the switchboard to act as a broker for all environment variables. Additionally, environment variables can now be specified on the command line or in a yaml file, and will be made available to all plugins via the switchboard. By [@astro-friedel](https://github.com/astro-friedel) in PR [#430](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/430)
- Misc
    - **Breaking**: Policies for contributing to the ILLIXR code base, as well as a general coding style guide have been introduced. The entire code base was overhauled to bring it into compliance with the style guide. By [@astro-friedel](https://github.com/astro-friedel) in PR [#419](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/419)
    - General documentation updates for ILLIXR. By [@astro-friedel](https://github.com/astro-friedel) in PR [#422](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/422)
    - Updated CMakeLists.txt to cleanly handle newer FindBoost capabilities, updated tags on some external packages, cleaned up CMake output, added some `include` lines required by newer gcc compiler versions, and added `all.yaml` profile for testing that the code fully builds. By [@astro-friedel](https://github.com/astro-friedel) in PR [#431](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/431)
    - Updated several external packages ILLIXR builds from source to newer versions. Official support for CentOS, Fedora, and Ubuntu 20 and below has been dropped, support for Ubuntu 24 has been added. By    [@astro-friedel](https://github.com/astro-friedel) in PR [#439](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/439)
    - Added automated release note generation by [@astro-friedel](https://github.com/astro-friedel) in PR [#441](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/441)
    - Major documentation updates, including up-to-date plugin listing and descriptions and more internal links to data types. By [@astro-friedel](https://github.com/astro-friedel) in PR [#447](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/447)

# ILLIXR v3.2.0 (Sept 19, 2023)

## Release Notes

* The biggest change is the complete rewriting of the build system. It now runs via CMake, making plugin management and dependency checking much more streamlined.
* ILLIXR added a new graphics pipeline using the Vulkan API, implemented in the new plugins vkdemo, timewarp_vk, dislpay_vk, and nativer_renderer. For details, see PR [#396](https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/pull/396) by [@shg8](https://github.com/shg8).
* ILLIXR has updated integration to support Monado's out-of-process compositor, which now allows users to run more OpenXR apps (Unreal Engine, Vulkan-based apps, etc) with direct mode.
* There are numerous updates to plugins as well as a few new ones (see details below)
* OpenVINS is now the default SLAM plugin.
* Kimera-VIO is no longer available for use with ILLIXR

## What's Changed
