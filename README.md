# Overview

Illinois Extended Reality testbed or ILLIXR (pronounced like elixir) is a fully open-source Extended Reality (XR)
system and testbed. The modular, extensible, and OpenXR-compatible ILLIXR runtime integrates state-of-the-art XR
components into a complete XR system.

The current ILLIXR release is [v4.0][E51]. Source code is available from our [GitHub repository][P68], which also contains
instructions for building fully contained [Docker images][E56].

ILLIXR provides its components in standalone configurations to enable architects and system designers to research each
component in isolation. The standalone components are packaged together as of the v3.1.0 release of ILLIXR.

ILLIXR's modular and extensible runtime allows adding new components and swapping different implementations of a given
component. ILLIXR currently contains the following [plugins][P66] and [services][P67]:

[^1]: Source is hosted in an external repository under the [ILLIXR project][E7].

Some components, such as eye tracking and reconstruction are available as standalone components and are in the process
of being integrated.

We continue to refine and add new components and implementations. Many of the current components of ILLIXR were
developed by domain experts and obtained from publicly available repositories. They were modified for one or more of the
following reasons: fixing compilation, adding features, or removing extraneous code or dependencies. Each component not
developed by us is available as a forked GitHub repository for proper attribution to its authors.

# Papers, talks, demos, consortium

A [paper][E8] with details on ILLIXR, including its components, runtime, telemetry support, and a comprehensive analysis
of performance, power, and quality on desktop and embedded systems.

[Video][E43].
[Slides][E44].

A [demo][E45] of an OpenXR application running with ILLIXR.

The [ILLIXR consortium][E37] is an industry-supported community effort to democratize XR systems research, development,
and benchmarking. Visit our [website][E37] for more information. For news and papers go to [illixr.org][E37], for talks

## Acknowledgements

The ILLIXR project started in [Sarita Adveâ€™s research group][E9],
co-led by PhD candidate Muhammad Huzaifa, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

ILLIXR came together after many consultations with researchers and practitioners in many domains:
audio,
graphics,
optics,
robotics,
signal processing,
and
extended reality systems.
We are deeply grateful for all of these discussions and specifically to the following:
Wei Cu,
Aleksandra Faust,
Liang Gao,
Matt Horsnell,
Amit Jindal,
Steve LaValle,
Steve Lovegrove,
Andrew Maimone,
Vegard &#216;ye,
Martin Persson,
Archontis Politis,
Eric Shaffer,
Paris Smaragdis,
Sachin Talathi,
and
Chris Widdowson.

Our OpenXR implementation is derived from [Monado][E10]. We are particularly thankful to Jakob Bornecrantz and Ryan
Pavlik.

The development of ILLIXR was supported by the Applications Driving Architectures (ADA) Research Center (a JUMP Center
co-sponsored by SRC and DARPA), the Center for Future Architectures Research (C-FAR, a STARnet research center), a
Semiconductor Research Corporation program sponsored by MARCO and DARPA, National Science Foundation grants 2120464 and
2217144 and by a Google Faculty Research Award. The development of ILLIXR was also aided by generous hardware and
software donations from ARM and NVIDIA. Facebook Reality Labs provided the [OpenEDS Semantic Segmentation Dataset][E11].

Wesley Darvin came up with the name for ILLIXR.

## Licensing Structure

ILLIXR is available as open-source software under the permissive [University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License][E34].
As mentioned above, ILLIXR largely consists of components developed by domain experts and modified for the purposes of
inclusion in ILLIXR. However, ILLIXR does contain software developed solely by us. **The NCSA license is limited to only
this software**. The external libraries and software included in ILLIXR each have their own licenses and must be used
according to those licenses:
