Illinois Extended Reality testbed or ILLIXR (pronounced like elixir) is
the first fully open-source Extended Reality (XR) system and testbed.
The modular, extensible, and [OpenXR][26]-compatible ILLIXR runtime
integrates state-of-the-art XR components into a complete XR system.
The testbed is part of the broader [ILLIXR consortium][37],
an industry-supported community effort to democratize XR systems
research, development, and benchmarking.

You can find the complete ILLIXR system [here][38].

ILLIXR also provides its components in standalone configurations to enable architects and
system designers to research each component in isolation.
The standalone components are packaged together in the as of the [v3.1.0 release][39] of ILLIXR.

ILLIXR's modular and extensible runtime allows adding new components and swapping different
implementations of a given component.
ILLIXR currently contains the following components:

- *Perception*
    - Eye Tracking
        1. [RITNet][3] **
    - Scene Reconstruction
        1. [ElasticFusion][2] **
        2. [KinectFusion][40] **
    - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
        1. [OpenVINS][1] **
    - Cameras and IMUs
        1. [ZED Mini][42]
        2. [Intel RealSense][41]

- *Visual*
    - [Chromatic aberration correction][5]
    - [Computational holography for adaptive multi-focal displays][6] **
    - [Lens distortion correction][5]
    - [Asynchronous Reprojection (TimeWarp)][5]

- *Aural*
    - [Audio encoding][4] **
    - [Audio playback][4] **

(** Source is hosted in an external repository under the [ILLIXR project][7].)

We continue to add more components (new components and new implementations).

Many of the current components of ILLIXR were developed by domain experts and obtained from
publicly available repositories.
They were modified for one or more of the following reasons: fixing compilation, adding features,
or removing extraneous code or dependencies.
Each component not developed by us is available as a forked GitHub repository for
proper attribution to its authors.

ILLIXR enables system innovations with end-to-end co-designed hardware, compiler, OS, and algorithms, and driven by end-user perceived Quality-of-Experience (QoE) metrics. Using ILLIXR, we provide the first comprehensive quantitative analysis of performance, power, and QoE for a complete XR system and its individual components.

## Acknowledgements

The ILLIXR project started in [Sarita Adveâ€™s research group][9],
co-led by PhD candidate Muhammad Huzaifa, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

and
Jeffrey Zhang.

ILLIXR came together after many consultations with researchers and practitioners in many domains:
audio,
graphics,
optics,
robotics,
signal processing,
and
extended reality systems.
We are deeply grateful for all of these discussions and specifically to the following:
Wei Cu,
Aleksandra Faust,
Liang Gao,
Matt Horsnell,
Amit Jindal,
Steve LaValle,
Steve Lovegrove,
Andrew Maimone,
Vegard &#216;ye,
Martin Persson,
Archontis Politis,
Eric Shaffer,
Paris Smaragdis,
Sachin Talathi,
and
Chris Widdowson.

Our OpenXR implementation is derived from [Monado][10].
We are particularly thankful to Jakob Bornecrantz and Ryan Pavlik.

The development of ILLIXR was supported by
the Applications Driving Architectures (ADA) Research Center
(a JUMP Center co-sponsored by SRC and DARPA),
the Center for Future Architectures Research (C-FAR, a STARnet research center),
a Semiconductor Research Corporation program sponsored by MARCO and DARPA,
and
by a Google Faculty Research Award.
The development of ILLIXR was also aided by generous hardware and software donations
from ARM and NVIDIA.
Facebook Reality Labs provided the [OpenEDS Semantic Segmentation Dataset][11].

Wesley Darvin came up with the name for ILLIXR.

## Licensing Structure

ILLIXR is available as open-source software under the permissive
[University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License][34].
As mentioned above, ILLIXR largely consists of components developed by domain experts and
modified for the purposes of inclusion in ILLIXR.
However, ILLIXR does contain software developed solely by us.
**The NCSA license is limited to only this software**.
The external libraries and software included in ILLIXR each have their own licenses and

<SUP>1</SUP> Current as of April 14, 2024.

<SUP>2</SUP> Also known as the Simplified BSD License.

<SUP>3</SUP> ILLIXR uses a customized version of FFmpeg, compiled with x264 and x265 encoding support, thus it is
licensed under GPL v3.0

<SUP>4</SUP> This software is covered by multiple open source licenses, see the link for details.

The optional [Open-VINS][P35] plugin (available from a secondary repository) is licensed under [GPL v3.0][L35].

Note that ILLIXR's extensibility allows the source to be configured and compiled using only
permissively licensed software.
