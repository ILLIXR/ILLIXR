# ILLIXR plugins

## Default Plugins

- [`offline_imu_cam`][5]: Reads IMU data and images from files on disk, emulating a real sensor on the
  headset (feeds input measurements with timing similar to an actual IMU).

- [`ground_truth_slam`][6]: Reads the ground-truth from the same dataset to compare our output against
  (uses timing from `offline_imu_cam`).

- [`kimera_vio`][13]: Runs Kimera-VIO ([upstream][1]) on the input, and outputs the headset's pose. In practice, this
  publishes a fairly slow pose, so IMU integration and pose prediction is required to infer a fast pose.

- [`gtsam_integrator`][15]: Integrates over all IMU samples since the last published SLAM pose to provide a fast-pose everytime a new IMU sample.
  arrives using the GTSAM library ([upstream][14]). 

- [`pose_prediction`][18]: Uses the latest IMU value to predict a pose for a future point in time.

- [`gldemo`][8]: Renders a static scene (into left and right eyebuffers) given the pose from `pose_prediction`.

- [`timewarp_gl`][9]: [Asynchronous reprojection][2] of the eyebuffers.

- [`debugview`][10]: Renders a frame for debug information.

- [`audio`][11]: TODO: this. By default this is disabled, since it requires an NVIDIA GPU.

- [`hologram`][12]: TODO: this. By default this is disabled, since it requires an NVIDIA GPU.

Below this point, we will use Switchboard terminology. Read the [API documentation on `switchboard`][3] for definitions.

- In the above figure, rectangles are plugins, cylinders are topics (the graph is bipartitioned
  between these two gorups).

- Solid arrows from plugins to topics represent publishing.

- Solid arrows from topics to plugins represent synchronous reading. They take some action for
  _every_ event which gets published on the topic.

- Solid arrows from topics to plugins represent asynchronous reading. They need to know just the
  _latest_ event on their topic.

- Imagine the topic as a trough filing with events from its publisher, being drained by its
  synchronous readers (AKA subscribers), while asynchronous readres just skim from the top.

See [Writing Your Plugin][4] to extend ILLIXR.

## Other Supported Plugins
ILLIXR supports additional plugins to replace some of the default plugins.

- [`open_vins`][7]: This is an alternate SLAM ([upstream][19]) that uses a MSCKF (Multi-State Constrained Kalman Filter) to determine poses via camera/IMU.
- [`rk4_integrator`][16]: Integrates over all IMU samples since the last published SLAM pose to provide a fast-pose everytime a new IMU sample arrives using RK4 integration.

See [Building ILLIXR][4] for more information on adding plugins to a config file.
