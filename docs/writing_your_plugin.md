# Writing Your Plugin

## Adding a New Plugin (Common Case)

In the common case, one need only define a `Makefile` with the line `include common/common.mk`
    and symlink common (`ln -s ../common common`).
This provides the necessary targets and uses the compiler `$(CXX)`,
    which is defined in Make based on the OS and environment variables.

-   It compiles `plugin.cpp` and any other `*.cpp` files into the plugin.

-   It will invoke a recompile the target any time any `*.hpp` or `*.cpp` file changes.

-   It compiles with C++17. You can change this in your plugin by defining
        `STDCXX = ...` before the `include`.
    This change will not affect other plugins; just yours.

-   Libraries can be added by appending to `LDFLAGS` and `CFLAGS`, for example

    <!--- language: lang-makefile -->

        LDFLAGS := $(LDFLAGS) $(shell pkg-config --ldflags eigen3)
        CFLAGS  := $(CFLAGS) $(shell pkg-config --cflags eigen3)

-   See the source for the exact flags.

-   Inserted the path of your directory into the `plugin`-list in `config.yaml`.


## Adding a New Plugin (General Case)

Each plugin can have a completely independent build system, as long as:

-   It defines a `Makefile` with targets for `plugin.dbg.so`, `plugin.opt.so`, and `clean`.
    Inside this `Makefile`, one can defer to another build system.

-   It's compiler maintains _ABI compatibility_ with the compilers used in every other plugin.
    Using the same version of Clang or GCC on the same architecture is sufficient for this.

-   It's path is inserted in the root `config.yaml`, in the plugin list.


## Tutorial

With this, you can extend ILLIXR for your own purposes.
You can also replace any existing functionality this way.

1.  Create a new directory anywhere for your new plugin and set it up for ILLIXR.
    We recommend you also push this plugin to a git repository on Github/Gitlab if you want it
        as a part of upstream ILLIXR in the future.

    -   Create a `Makefile` with the following contents.
        See [Building ILLIXR][10] for more details and alternative setups.

        <!--- language: lang-makefile -->

            include common.mk

1.  You must decide if your plugin should inherit the standardized [`threadloop`][12]
        or [`plugin`][13].

    -   If your plugin just needs to run one computation repeatedly,
            then your plugin class should extend [`threadloop`][12].

    -   If you need custom concurrency (more complicated than a loop),
            triggered concurrency (by events fired in other plugins),
            or no concurrency then your plugin class should extend [`plugin`][13].
			
        - If you spin your own threads, they **must** wait for
          `pb->lookup_impl<Stoplight>()->wait_for_ready()` the first time they
          run. This allows the start of all threads in ILLIXR to be
          synchronized.

        - They **must** be joined-or-disowned at-or-before
          `plugin::stop()`. This allows ILLIXR to shutdown cleanly.

1.  Write a file called `plugin.cpp` with this body, replacing every instance of `plugin_name`:

    <!--- language: lang-cpp -->

        #include "common/phonebook.hpp"
        #include "common/plugin.hpp"
        #include "common/threadloop.hpp"

        using namespace ILLIXR;

        /// Inherit from `plugin` if you don't need the threadloop
        class plugin_name : public threadloop {
        public:
            plugin_name(std::string name_, phonebook* pb_)
                : threadloop{name_, pb_}
                { }
            virtual void start() override { }
            virtual ~plugin_name() override { }
        };

        // This line makes the plugin importable by Spindle
        PLUGIN_MAIN(plugin_name);

1.  At this point, you should be able to build your plugin with ILLIXR.
    Move to the ILLIXR repo and update `configs/native.yaml`.
    If the new plugin is the same type as one of the other components you will need to
        remove that component from the config before running the new component.
    For example, if the new component is a SLAM then the old SLAM needs to be removed from
        the config.
    See [Building ILLIXR][10] for more details on the config file.

    <!--- language: lang-yaml -->

        plugin_groups:
          - !include "rt_slam_plugins.yaml"
          - !include "core_plugins.yaml"
          - plugin_group:
             - path: /PATH/TO/NEW/PLUGIN
             - path: ground_truth_slam/
             - path: gldemo/
             - path: debugview/
   
        data:
          subpath: mav0
          relative_to:
          archive_path:
          download_url: 'http://robotics.ethz.ch/~asl-datasets/ijrr_euroc_mav_dataset/vicon_room1/V1_02_medium/V1_02_medium.zip'
          demo_data: demo_data/
          loader:
            name: native
            # command: gdb -q --args %a
            profile: opt

1.  Finally, run ILLIXR with your new plugin with the following command:

    <!--- language: lang-shell -->

        ./runner.sh configs/native.yaml

1.  This is all that is required to be a plugin which can be loaded by Spindle in
        the ILLIXR runtime.
    Reading and writing from Phonebook and Switchboard is optional,
        but nearly every plugin does it.
    See `default_plugins.md` for more details.

    First, we can query the [`phonebook`][11] to get various services
        including [`switchboard`][14].
    Then we query [`switchboard`][14] for event-streams (topics).
    We will read `topic1`, write to `topic2`, and schedule computation on `topic 3`.
    See the API documentation for `phonebook` and `switchboard` for more details.
