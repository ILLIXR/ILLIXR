# Making a Feature Request

Do you have a new feature or improvement in mind for ILLIXR? We'd love to hear about it! Please follow the steps below
to submit a feature request.

- Ensure the feature, or something very similar, was not already requested by searching on GitHub under [Issues][1].
- If an issue request for the feature/improvement already exists, feel free to add a comment to the existing issue with
  any additional ideas or insights you think are relevant.
- If you're unable to find one that covers your idea, [open a new one][2]. Be sure to include a title, clear
  description, and as much relevant information as possible. Please be descriptive as possible so that the developers
  can fully understand what you are requesting.
- Once the issue is created a team member will review it, and it will be discussed for inclusion in the future as
  resources allow.
- If you already have a solution in mind, consider submitting a pull request with the new feature or improvement. See
  the [Creating a Pull Request][3] documentation for more information.
