# ILLIXR Services

This page details the structure of ILLIXR's [_services_][58] and how they interact with each other.


## fauxpose

An alternate tracking implementation that simply generates "fast_pose"
data from a simple mathematical algorithm (circular movement).  The intent
is for use when debugging other plugins and the developer wants a known
pose trajectory without having to configure actual tracking.

Topic details:
-   *Provides* [`fast_pose_type`][60]
-   Asynchronously *reads* `time_type` from `vsync_estimate` topic.

&nbsp;&nbsp;[**Details**][D42]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[**Code**][C42]

## pose_prediction

Uses the latest [_IMU_][36] value to predict a [_pose_][37] for a future point in time.
Implements the `pose_prediction` service,
so poses can be served directly to other plugins.

Topic details:

-   Asynchronously *reads* [`pose_type`][61] on `slow_pose` topic, but it is only used as a fallback.
-   Asynchronously *reads* `imu_raw` on `imu_raw` topic.
-   Asynchronously *reads* [`pose_type`][61] on `true_pose` topic, but it is only used if the client asks for the true pose.
-   Asynchronously *reads* `time_type` on `vsync_estimate` topic. This tells `pose_predict` what time to estimate for.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Details**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[**Code**][C44]

## pose_lookup

Implements the `pose_predict` service, but uses [_ground truth_][33] from the dataset.
The plugin peeks "into the future" to determine what the exact [_pose_][37] will be at a certain time.

Topic details:

-   Asynchronously *reads* `time_point` on `vsync_estimate` topic. This tells `pose_lookup` what time to lookup.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Details**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[**Code**][C43]

## vkdemo
