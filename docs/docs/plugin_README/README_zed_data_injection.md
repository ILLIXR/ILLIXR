# ZED Data Injection

This plugin reads in binocular images and pose information from files on disk and publishes them to ILLIXR. It is
designed to feed data recorded by the zed_capture binary into the ILLIXR system. The root directory of the data
must be specified in the `ILLIXR_TEST_DATA` environment variable.
