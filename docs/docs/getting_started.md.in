# Getting Started

ILLIXR is configured and built via CMake. The CMake system checks for required dependencies,
builds each requested plugin, builds the main ILLIXR binary, and (optionally) installs these components.

ILLIXR currently only builds on Linux systems, and has been tested on the following configurations:

- Ubuntu
    - 22.04
    - 24.04
- Fedora[^1]
    - 38+

[^1]: Primary development is aimed at Ubuntu systems, full support for Fedora may require extra work on the users part.

Other versions of these operating systems may work, but will likely require some manual installation of dependencies.
For other Linux distributions (e.g. RHEL) it will require significant manual installation of dependencies as many
are not available in the distribution repos. The instructions below are a generalized version.

## Building ILLIXR

### Clone the repository

``` { .bash .copy }
git clone https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR --single-branch
```

This will clone only the default branch, if you want all branches then remove the `--single-branch` flag.

### Install dependencies

There are two levels of dependencies in ILLIXR: those that are required for any type of build, and those that are
required only for specific plugins.

#### Select your operating system and version

<table id="operating_system" style="border-spacing: 20px; border: 1px solid black;"></table>

ILLIXR may compile with other versions of the above operating systems, but some of the necessary prerequesite packages are not supplied by the OS repos and will need to be compiled by hand. You should be able to use the package and cmake commands for other versions of the same OS (other than the missing packages) to compile ILLIXR. RHEL is not supported at this time as many of the prerequisite packages are not natively available.

#### Pick the ILLIXR plugins you want to use

<table id="profile_table" style="border-spacing: 8px; border: 1px solid black;"></table>
<table id="listing_table" style="border-spacing: 8px; border: 1px solid black;"></table>

<table style="border-spacing: 20px; border: 1px solid black;">
    <tr><td>Include virtualization support: <input type="checkbox" id="withVirt" onclick="updateChecked();"><br>See <a class="reference internal" href="../virtualization/">ILLIXR Under Virtualization</a> for details.</td></tr>
</table>

<div id="notes"></div>

Use the following to install the dependencies for the selected plugins:

<div class="code-box-copy">

    <button class="code-box-copy__btn" data-clipboard-target="#output" title="Copy"></button>
    <pre class="language-shell" id="output" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></pre>

</div>

<div id="depinstall">
</div>


<div id="postnotes">
</div>

<br>

#### Build command

Use the following to build and install ILLIXR. You can specify the install location by giving the path to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.
If you want the default install path then do not add the option to the command line.

!!! warning

    If your install prefix requires sudo privileges then you will need to run both the build and install under sudo (this is due to the way cmake builds and installs some of the pre-packaged dependencies during the build phase).

Some ILLIXR plugins rely on code that falls under the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/gpl-3-0">GNU General Public License (GPL) v3.0</a>
or <a href="https://opensource.org/license/lgpl-2-1">GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v2.1</a>. If you do not wish to build
these codes you can select to exclude them below (or add `-DNO_GPL=ON` or `-DNO_LGPL=ON` to your cmake command line, NO_LGPL=ON implies
the same for NO_GPL).

<input type="checkbox" onclick="updateGPL();" id="no_gpl">No GPL code<br>
<input type="checkbox" onclick="updateLGPL();" id="no_lgpl">No LGPL code

<div id="cmake" class="code-box-copy">
    <button class="code-box-copy__btn" data-clipboard-target="#cmakeoutput" title="Copy"></button>
    <pre class="language-shell" id="cmakeoutput"></pre>
</div>

Common CMake command line arguments (always prepend with a `-D`):

-  ***CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX***
   The root path to install the libraries and binary to. This defaults to `/usr/local`.
-  ***CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE***
   The build type to do: Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo
-  ***YAML_FILE***
   The [_profile_][G23] file of [plugins][G22] to build and install. The default is None, meaning plugins should be specified individually on the command line.
-  ***USE_&lt;PLUGIN_NAME&gt;=ON***
   Build the specifically named [plugin][G22] (e.g `-DUSE_TIMEWARP_VK=ON` to build the timewarp_vk [plugin][G22]). Any number of [plugins][G22] can be specified on the command line in this fashion.
-  ***BUILD_DOCS***
   Set to `ON` to enable building the documentation.

!!! note "Documentation Prerequisites"

    Building the documentation requires [Doxygen][E14] and [mkdocs][E15](>= v1.5) to be installed, both of which are typically available from OS packages. Additionally, we utilize the [material][E16], [mkdocs-material-extensions][E19], [mkdocs-get-deps][E20], [mkdocs-include-markdown-plugin][E21], [PyMdown][E17], [Pygments][E18], [mkdoxy][E22], and [mkdocs-glightbox][E23] python packages, which can be installed via [pip][E24] using `docs/requirements.txt`.

An alternate to specifying the plugins as command line arguments is to create a [_YAML_][G12] file which specifies the
plugins to build. Using `-DYAML_FILE=&lt;FILE_NAME&gt;` as the command line argument specifying the [_YAML_][G12] file to use.

!!! note "You may need to specify the full path to the YAML_FILE"

    See [profile][G23] for the format.

The current list of plugins is: @FULL_PLUGIN_LIST_STRING@

The CMake process will also create a [_YAML_][G12] file call `illixr.yaml` which can be used as input to the binary.

## Running ILLIXR

To run the ILLIXR binary just call `main.<>.exe` with any of the following command line arguments. (the `&lt;&gt;` indicate
an infix specifying the build type, for `Debug` use `dbg`, for `Release` use `opt`, for `RelWithDebInfo` use `optdbg`)

- -p,--plugins=<>, comma separated list of plugins to use (case sensitive, all lowercase, no spaces)
- -y,--yaml=<>, the [profile][G23] file to use which specifies some or all of the above arguments (e.g. the generated `illixr.yaml`)
- --<ANY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE NAME>, you can specify any variable the ILLIXR uses on the command line. Common ones are:
  - --duration=<>, the duration to run for in seconds (default is 60)
  - --data=<>, the data file to use
  - --demo_data=<>, the demo data to use
  - --enable_offload
  - --enable_alignment
  - --enable_verbose_errors, give more information about errors
  - --enable_pre_sleep, force ILLIXR to sleep for the given number of seconds before starting the plugins (this is useful for attaching a debugger)

Regarding parameters for the binary, the following priority will be used:
1. If the parameter is specified on the command line it will have the highest priority
2. If the parameter has a value in the yaml file this value will only be used if it is not specified on the command line (second priority)
3. If the parameter has a value as an environment variable this value will only be used if it is not specified on the command line nor yaml file

Please refer to the [display backend][I12] for instructions on setting display-related environment variables.

For specific usage instructions, refer to the README files of the respective plugins.

### Profile file format
An example of a [_YAML_][G12] [profile][G23] file is
```yaml
plugins: pose_lookup,timewarp_vk,vkdemo,native_renderer
build_type: Debug
install_prefix: /home/user/illixr
env_vars:
  ILLIXR_RUN_DURATION: 5
  DATA: data/mav0
  DEMO_DATA: demo_data
  ENABLE_OFFLOAD: false
  ENABLE_ALIGNMENT: false
  ENABLE_VERBOSE_ERRORS: false
  ENABLE_PRE_SLEEP: false
```

Where the entries are defined as (* indicates required field):

- plugins *
: Comma separated list of plugins (case-sensitive) to build or load at runtime.

- build_type
: The type of build to perform (Debug, Release, or RelWithDebInfo). Ignored at run time.

- install_prefix
: The root path to where the compiled libraries and binaries should be installed. (e.g. specifying /home/user will install libraries in /home/user/lib and binaries in /home/user/bin).

  !!! note

      The prefix is also used for installing any packages that were downloaded and build from external repositories (e.g. DBoW2, GTSAM, etc). At runtime this path is added to *LD_LIBRARY_PATH* to aid in finding the plugin libraries.

- env_vars
: environment variables to use, any environment variable ILLIXR uses can be set here and will be valid during program execution.


In general, you should not edit a [profile][G23] file directly. The exception to this is when you are testing things on your own machine. [Profile][G23] files are generated automatically from the master `profiles/plugins.yaml` during the cmake configuration stage. This is done so that any changes to a [profile][G23] or the addition or removal of a [plugin][G22] can be managed from a single file. The build system will generate an *illixr.yaml* file which contains entries from the command line and any input profile file and can be freely edited (it is generated every time `cmake` is called).

## Environment Variables

ILLIXR and several of its dependencies use environment variables to steer processing and define quasi-constant values. Traditionally, one would use std::getenv and std::setenv to get and set these items. However, in ILLIXR the switchboard acts as an interface to these functions with `get_env` (returns std::string), `get_env_bool` (returns bool), `get_env_char` (returns char*), and `set_env`. Using the switchboard interfaces allows for environment variables to be set from the command line and/or yaml file. It is strongly encouraged to the switchboard interface wherever possible. Any items given on the command line which do not match expected command line arguments are considered to be environment variables. For example:

```bash
main.dbg.exe --yaml=my.yaml --DATA_SOURCE=/home/my/data --PROCESS_DATA
```

This will set env environment variables `DATA_SOURCE` to `/home/my/data` and `PROCESS_DATA` to `True`. For yaml files, any items not in the expected set will be considered to be environment variables. For example:

```yaml
plugins: fauxpose,timewarp_vk,vkdemo,debugview,audio_pipeline
enable_offload: false
env_vars:
  DATA_SOURCE: /home/my/data
  PROCESS_DATA: true
```

Here, the keywords `plugins` and `enable_offload` are ignored, as they are expected options. The `DATA_SOURCE` and `PROCESS_DATA` entries will cause environment variables to be set to the respective values.

!!! note

    The names and values of the environment variables are case-sensitive.

!!! note

    The `get_env_bool` considers any of 'y', 'yes', 'true', 'on' (case-insensitive), and "1" to be `true`.

### Common Environment Variables

- illixr_run_duration
: The duration to run ILLIXR for in seconds.

- data
: Path to the data file to download (build step) or use at runtime. If a URL is given (must start with http or https) the file will be downloaded and extracted; the path to the extracted data will be put in the illixr.yaml file.

- demo_data
: The path to the demonstration data to use at runtime (ignored by build steps)

- enable_offload
: ? Default is *false*

- enable_alignment
: ? Default is *false*

- enable_verbose_errors
: Controls the verbosity of error messages. Default is *false*

- enable_pre_sleep
: Force ILLIXR to sleep for the given number of seconds before starting the plugins (this is useful for attaching a debugger), Default is 0, indicating no sleeping.

Each plugin can define environment variables to use. See the documentation of each plugin for details.

## ILLIXR Graphics Backends

ILLIXR currently supports both OpenGL and Vulkan backends (indicated as `gl` and `vk` in the config suffixes). Since some plugins should behave differently (and compile differently) based on what backend is being used, it's important to run `make clean` if you want to try swapping between the two backends.

!!! warning

    The use of the OpenGL back end is in the process of being deprecated. Thus `gl` based plugins are not guaranteed to work in every instance.

## Rationale

-  The current system can use profile files to control everything from the build to running ILLIXR, in keeping with the [DRY principle][E10].
   However, for maximum flexibility control can also be done at the command line level as well.


## Philosophy

-   Each plugin should not have to know or care how the others are compiled.
    In the future, they may even be distributed separately, just as SOs.
    Therefore, each plugin needs its own build system.

-   Despite this per-plugin flexibility, building the 'default' set of ILLIXR plugins
    should be extremely easy.

-   It should be easy to build in parallel.

-   Re-running `make` (and optionally `cmake` first) will only rebuild those parts of the code with have changed.


## Next Steps

Try browsing the source for the runtime and provided plugins.
The source code is divided into components in the following directories:

-   `ILLIXR/src/`:
    A directory holding the implementation for loading and interfacing plugins.
    This directory contains [_Spindle_][G13].

-   `ILLIXR/include/illixr/`:
    A directory holding resources and utilities available globally to all plugins.
    This directory contains the interfaces for [_Switchboard_][G14] and [_Phonebook_][G15].

-   `ILLIXR/plugins/<plugin_dir>/`:
    A unique directory for each plugin.
    Most of the core XR functionality is implemented via plugins.
    See [Default Components][I10] for more details.

If you edit any of the source files, the CMake system will detect and rebuild the respective binary
the next time it runs.
